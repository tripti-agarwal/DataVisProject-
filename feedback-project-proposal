Feedback:
The project name should not have a short formsBackground and the motivation looks good.
Objective: Will you be connecting the three windows together?
Overall review: The project looks interesting and will be fun to explore.
If your project does not have enough interactivity, it will be very simple and will be difficult to defend. Also since you do not have to clean up the dataset, I will suggest you have more features in your scatterplot and bar chart. For example, a drop-down menu to select a team.
If you want more ideas we can set up a meeting and talk about them. Thanks :)
